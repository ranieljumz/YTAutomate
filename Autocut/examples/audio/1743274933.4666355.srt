00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Did you know that the United States came incredibly close to having a 51st state?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In the 1970s, the island of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
held a referendum to decide its political future.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Over 75% of voters chose to pursue statehood,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but the movement lost momentum due to political and logistical challenges.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Guam remains a territory today,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but its unique history raises fascinating questions about what could have been.

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Imagine the flag with an extra star!
